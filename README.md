# we-friendly-wireframes

(Proposal - will make it more catchy/user-friendly)
The "we-friendly" app would allow users to review businesses and services specifically for how "-friendly" 
they are to members of certain communities against whom people historically discriminate. The target 
demographic for the app would be users who are members of these communities, who want non-discriminatory 
experiences. The categories of communities would be: "Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, Latinx, and Indigenous 
persons", "Disabled persons", "Migrants/Immigrants", "LGBTQIA+", and "Women" . The categories of businesses 
would be "restaurant/bar", "shopping", "hotel/accommodations", "service", "housing/realty", "education", 
and "healthcare". "Users can create an account to rate/review businesses, as well as to search for reviews
of businesses, filtering by specific business and community categories, and sorting by rating.
